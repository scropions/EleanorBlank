/// @brief  FileSystem interface.
///
/// This is used for loading File URLs (eg, <file:///page.html>).
///
/// You can provide the library with your own FileSystem implementation so that file assets are
/// loaded from your own pipeline (useful if you would like to encrypt/compress your file assets or
/// ship it in a custom format).
///
/// AppCore automatically provides a platform-specific implementation of this that loads files from
/// a local directory when you call App::Create().
///
/// If you are using Renderer::Create() instead, you will need to provide your own implementation
/// via `Platform::instance().set_file_system(). For convenience, you can still use AppCore's file
/// system implementation-- see the helper functions defined in <AppCore/Platform.h>.
///
/// To provide your own custom FileSystem implementation, you should inherit from this class,
/// handle the virtual member functions, and then pass an instance of your class to
/// `Platform::instance().set_file_system()` before calling Renderer::Create() or App::Create().
///
